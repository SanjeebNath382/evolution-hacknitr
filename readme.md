## Problem Statement :
Rural and Remote residents encounter barriers to healthcare that restrain their ability to get the medical services they need. The problem of handling and keeping a note and regular monitoring is serious in India. Also, it has been continuously observed in no. of surveys that the nurses and doctors in India suffer through burnout due to heavy workload and hectic schedule, which is a matter of concern. The records of patients are not well-maintained on either grounds and hence seems to be a greater problem in the picture.

Also, in the current synopsis, extremely transmittable diseases like COVID-19 have forced people to avail of home hospitalization and treatment and, that's why treating everyone in need of continuous monitoring and regular checkup is difficult. 

May it be a pandemic or the problem of distance, consulting a good doctor even for a regular checkup and urgent situations that need to be dealt with as soon as possible is a big issue. There's a need for proper management of a patient's historical record and, tracking of current health-stats is one of the challenges in front of the Medical System in India.

Hence, a solution needs to be proposed that solves the problems efficiently and is even accessible to all.

## Why this issue?
India has a vital shortage of trained doctors universally when compared to the WHO recommended ratio. Additionally, with about 80 per cent of the medicinal workforce focused in the top 8-10 towns and treating only 28 per cent of the total residents, access to healthcare remains a hope for many. In rural India, a patient may have to travel to another city to meet a doctor. The necessity of time is to provide good quality healthcare and a home-monitored healthcare system, to minimize the workload on the medical workforce monitor and patients with low or mild problems remotely.

## Objectives :
- To connect patients in remote and rural areas with the best doctors of their choice.
- To provide essential medical services at the lowest possible cost.
- To provide a proper patient medical history management system.
- To provide proper patient monitoring equipment in remote areas, where medical reach is hard or disconnected due to lack of connectivity.
- To evolve, innovate and renovate the concept of Tele-medicine using IoT.
- To promote technical job opportunities for people to work as an authorized user of the MedIoT kit.
- To make the process of Policy claims easier for the patients, with all the legal procedure documents required for policy claims available online

MedIoT is an IoT web-based Real-Time Health Monitoring and Medical Consultation System. 



The IoT system connects to the cloud that lets the authenticated person keep a real-time check on some basic parameters like Heart-Rate, Blood Pressure, Temperature, ECG Function, Glucose Level, Dissolved Oxygen Level, etc. Using Bio-Sensors and Microprocessor that transmits the data to Firebase and Udibots for storage in the database and henceforth is accessible by the authenticated person(doctor and the user).<br><br>

The website offers people better access to healthcare support beyond their bounds of convenience and connects them to doctors, specialists and healthcare experts on a digital platform, which provides them access to an online expert without a physical visit. For doctors, it includes a feature to view-track the medical record of the patient regularly and efficiently.
